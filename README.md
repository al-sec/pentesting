# OverTheWire Wargames
http://overthewire.org/wargames/

The wargames offered by the OverTheWire community can help you to learn and practice security concepts in the form of fun-filled games.
Personally, I learned a lot by repeatedly trying to get as far as I could in a short span of time (eg. seeing what level you can get to over the course of a lunch break).
Everyone recommends to start out with the Bandit challenges and progress from there, working your way up to full blown attack/defense scenarios.

There is a variety of ways to do all of these challenges, I will add different methods if they are worthy or notable.
I don't always do things the same way, BASH is like play-doh :)
If you have another method or a way of doing things, submit them!
