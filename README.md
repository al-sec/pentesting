# iosecurity.io - Pentesting
This is a central repository for any relevant information that might make a pentesting job a little easier. Mainly, /pentesting includes a collection of scripts, tools, guides, walkthroughs and/or references that are used for computer security training and educational purposes only. Subjects may range from real world scenarios to CTFs, Attack/Defense, VulnHub, HackTheBox, etc. Note that I'm certainly not accountable for what you do with any of the stuff, that's for sure. There may also be ***spoilers*** in here as well for certain online hacking games and challenges. Don't say you haven't been warned.
